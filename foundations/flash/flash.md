Unstrictly, you can say AS3 is also javascript, which is a great implementation of ES4 in sevaral years ago. AS3 has implemented many syntax like strong typed language as Java. So It is perfect to use developing webapp,air, mobile,  and in particular, webgame!. Nowadays, still up to 90% of media web application develped by as3 hosted in Flash Player.
