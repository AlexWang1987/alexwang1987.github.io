# ES6(2015)

ES6 introduces many exciting features, which make javascript more robust and appropriate for complex application. Many of them are adopted from other excellent languages. I'll not show what added features, but why we need it. The first one is:

### Modularity
**Javascript** has its internal module constructure finally.

### class
which is obvious used to declare `class` structure like other standard OOP langugaes. but cores concepts still the same. They are just sugary syntax.
