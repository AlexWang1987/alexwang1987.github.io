# CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)

## Core Concepts

#### What important role the CSS is playing at?

> CSS is a stylesheet language used to *skin* the presentation of the **Structured Elements** ( also known as **HTML** or **XML based** languages, such as SVG,XHTML) on various medias(paper ,speech, screen etc).

In a sentence:
> CSS adds **style attributes** to **tree-like nested components** in a **cascading way** on different **medias**.

Now, The question is that how many types of style attributes the CSS can manipulate.

* CSS Box Model ( one of core modules of CSS)
> You can think of every web component as a box. Its attributes used for visual formatting.
* Flexible Box(another of core modules of CSS3)
> you can think of it as better Box Model introduced in CSS3. best appropriate for different devices and screens. A flex container expands items to fill available free space or squeeze them to prevent overflow. and It's suit for components of applications.
